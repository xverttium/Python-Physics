As a physics student, i find experimentation a valuable mean to help retain knowledge and to express creativity. What better way, then, to a lazy-ass home-stayer, than python-coding? I made this to share some of my simple and naivy, yet dreamy, physics codes on python. They are not complex, but may inspire someone.
